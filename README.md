# Steps for creating this chatbot: ðŸ”§ Setup & Run
## 1- Prepare vector database
for creating the vector database, you need API key for  qdrant_url and api key for embeding model, which I used openai for text-embedding-3-small 
There are a lot of options for creating a small and free vector database for learning purpose, for this chatbot I've used Qdrant.
Creating a Qdrant Cluster is staightforward. You need to create an account in Qdrant and create a free cluster, and get your API key.
In the update_database file you will find how to create vector database.
after having all api keys and urls, choose a name for your database (collection name), and create a create qdrant collection, then createpoints for questions and answers and upsert(add) them to your collection.

## 2- create a retiriever to retrieve the data
in the rag.py you will find the retriever function to retrive the similar questions and answers for user input.

## 3 llm.py
```
class OpenAIClient:
    def __init__(self, openai_api_key, department, level):
        self.client = OpenAI(api_key=openai_api_key)
        self.department = department
        self.level = level
    def build_prompt(self, policy_summary, user_question) -> list[dict]:
        """Returns a messages list ready for ChatCompletion.create()."""

    def generate_response(self, messages: List) -> str:
        """Calls OpenAI and returns the assistantâ€™s answer."""
```
## 4- Build your App
